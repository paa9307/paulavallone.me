        <div class="text"><b>Major Update 2.2 for the Quest 2 version. Update released on September 9th, 2022</b><br><br></div>
        <div class="text">Initially, I was assigned as the sole developer to what was supposed to be a small update that was slated to take a couple of weeks to fix a few bugs.
            After investigating, I pushed for a much larger update to ensure a higher level of quality. 
            The update eventually grew to a team of 10 developers made up of engineers, producers, artists, and QA. It was worked on for several months instead of several weeks.
            I worked to improve player interactions, game visuals, and menu UI. 
            To update the alien model, I worked closely with the studio art director and the technical art director.
            I pushed for and added accessibility features. 
            I went through an extensive amount of bug fixing initially by myself but later with the help of QA and other engineers.
            We also updated the credits which meant I earned my first official video game credit.

                    Since its launch in 2019, hundreds of thousands of people have ignored our warning, and pressed the big red button! Actually, you've touched a lot of things that we specifically asked you not to, discovering that what appears to be a simple room with a screen and an enticing red button is actually hiding countless clues, devious puzzles, and insane consequences ranging from ending the world, to taking you back in time.

                    <br><br>To celebrate the game's 3rd anniversary, we've been working on a big update for the game to address player feedback, improve quality of life, and, in spots, give the game some visual polish. Plus countless bug fixes!
                    <br>
                    <br>NEW
<br>* Achievements! We now support Meta Achievements in the game - try and unlock them all!
<br>* Seated Mode. Players can now play the game seated. Take a load off and relax!
<br>* Height Adjustment. You can now manually adjust your player height in the game settings.
<br>* Distance Grab. Grabbable objects can now be interacted with at a distance, making it easier for players using a stationary boundary, playing in seated mode, or with limited mobility.
<br>* Snap Rotation. Flick the thumbstick left/right to do small quick turns. Flick the thumbstick back to do a 180 quick turn.
<br>
<br>IMPROVEMENTS
<br>* Complete interaction overhaul. We've gone through every interaction in the game and reworked them to make it easier to grab, throw, press, and toggle objects in the room.
<br>* Improvements to handling the Hammer, Screwdriver, and Phone.
<br>* Thrown objects will no longer disappear/fall through the world
<br>* Grabbable object highlighting. A green outline will appear around grabbable objects, making them much easier to find.
<br>* Teleport UI improvements. Now much easier to see where you can and cannot teleport to.
<br>* We've enhanced 10 of the game's endings to add more visual excitement.
<br>-- Visual improvements to the creature model in the alien ending.
<br>* Added haptics to more interactions:
<br>-- Pushing buttons
<br>-- Hover over grabbable objects
<br>-- Grab/release objects
<br>-- Hit something with the hammer
<br>-- Write on or erase the whiteboard
<br>* Fixed missing font characters in Polish and Turkish translations
<br>* Menu additions/improvements:
<br>-- Player Height slider
<br>-- Standing / Seated Mode toggle
<br>-- Distance Grab toggle
<br>-- Player Controls Diagram
<br>-- Improved highlighting in Language selection
