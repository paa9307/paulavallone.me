        <h1>Please, Don't Touch Anything: <br>House Broken</h1>
        <div class="text"><b>Released on December 7th, 2023 for the Quest 3, Quest Pro, & Quest 2</b><br><br></div>
        <div class="text">While still working on the major update to the Quest 2 version of the first game, I was asked how easy it would be to add hand tracking into the game. 
            The answer was that it wasn't. 
            It was originally thought that we would maybe add additional endings to the game too but it evolved to be a potential mixed reality (MR) sequel for the still in development Quest 3. 
            After the update was done, I was tasked with investigating MR's capabilities and how we would make a MR game and more specifically, as a <i>Please, Don't Touch Anything</i> (<i>PDTA</i>) sequel. 
            <br><br>
            Given the working title, <i>PDTAMR</i>, I wrote thorough documentation on the Quest 2 and Pro's MR abilities and limitations. I performed comparison tests between making MR in Unreal vs Unity.
            It was chosen to abandon <i>PDTA</i>'s Unity engine for Unreal Engine 4 and later 5. 
            I investigated the small pool of MR titles released at the time and compiled best practices for our new game. 
            After it was greenlit, the project grew to include more developers until we were a full team made up of passionate designers, engineers, producers, artists, and QA's.
            As the team member armed with the most knowledge of the previous game and MR, I helped lay the groundwork for the game and was a point of reference for the new team members.
            I collaborated closely with the lead designer and others to brainstorm a lot of what you see in the final product. 
            I co-designed and programmed interactions, puzzles, and endings. 
            As a team, we participated in regular playtest and feedback sessions to make the game the best it could be.
            My work on <i>House Broken</i> earned me another video game credit.
