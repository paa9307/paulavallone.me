        <div class="text">
            Made with a small team in Unreal Engine 5 at The Devhouse Agency for a client. It was developed to be a prototype for an open world hunting simulator with a narrative. 
            It is an exact satellite scan of Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. It was designed to be played both as a normal FPS and in VR. 
            I was hired very early into the project when there was only a design doc, a rough script, and a fairly barren landscape. 
            When I first got started on the team, I scoped out and clarified the VR design requirements, worked to tighten up the script, and did the first pass of the level design flow for the narrative path.
            <br><br>
I designed and programmed the inventory system. The player mechanics that were stored in this system were also done by me. 
I had to implement the gun, binoculars, wind detector, GPS, and rangefinder and made sure they all worked with keyboard and mouse, controller, and VR controls. 
The button mappings were designed by me. UI like the main menu, pause screen, loading screen, tutorial popups, closed captions, and inventory were all implemented by me. 
In addition to standard player movement, I also programmed the stamina system that tied into breathing audio. 
It would play more strained breath the more the player ran and eventually would force walk. 
Stamina was also tied into gun shake. Every sound effect that is in the game besides the character dialog was implemented by me. 
I made it so roaming NPC animals decal tracks are placed and change color the older they get and eventually disappear. 
The free roam NPC AI logic was done by another member of the team but I regularly helped brainstorm and debug their behaviors with them.
<br><br>
This was a very collaborative team effort. I worked extremely closely with the lead engineer, the artists, the producers, and QA. 
We constantly helped improve each other’s work. We consistently had sprint meetings and discussions about scope and priorities to keep things on track.
