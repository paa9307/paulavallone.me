                <p class="bio">
                    Originally from Smithtown, New York, Paul went to Rochester Institute of Technology in 2016 with the dream of becoming a game developer. 
                    In May of 2020 he graduated Magna Cum Laude with a BS in Game Design and Development and a minor in Computer Science. 
                    After graduating he got a job at Netsmart as a Software Engineer. 
                    About a year later, he left after he got a job in the games industry at ForwardXP as a Software Engineer and moved down to Dallas, Texas where he worked for two years on a variety of different game projects. 
                    
                    <br><br>Currently, he is working at The Devhouse Agency on an unannounced Unreal Engine 5 game. His side project, Usurper, is releasing on Steam on September 9th, 2024 and has a demo out now.
                    
                    <br><br>A creatively driven individual who loves collaborating with people of all disciplines to make incredible games. 
                    He has professional experience designing and programming games in Unreal and Unity. 
                    Always asks, why settle for good when it can be great? 

                    <br><br>Some of his hobbies include art, film, video games, ice skating, and racquetball.
